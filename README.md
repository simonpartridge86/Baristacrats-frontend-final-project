## Project Description

Chews is a mobile-first web app created by [Simon Partridge](https://github.com/simonpartridge86), [Adam Phasey](https://github.com/AdamPhasey), [Sam Wylie](https://github.com/samsonhumber), [Maurizio Monti](https://github.com/mauriziomonti), [Kunal Shukla](https://github.com/kun-shukla) and [Mino Devito](https://github.com/MagicMino) during the final project at [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) bootcamp. We were challenged to come up with an app that solves any problem of our choice in a four-week challenge.

The problem we identified was decision fatigue around meal/recipe selection, which has been exacerbated by the increased amount of home-cooking during the COVID pandemic and the 2022 cost-of-living crisis. This problem can result in a lack of inspiration in the kitchen and sap the joy out of cooking.

The resulting app, "Chews" is a web app that helps users quickly and easily find a recipe suggestion for their next meal, either at random or based on ingredients in their pantry, greatly reducing any searching or decision-making on their part.

Please view the app in deployment here: [chews.vercel.app](https://chews.vercel.app/)

## Skills & Retrospective

This was our second experience of a group project on School of Code, and aimed to apply knowledge gained throughout School of Code bootcamp, as well as getting further experience of the following skills:

- Agile methodologies and tools
- Project planning & management
- UX/UI design processes
- Cooperation and decision making in a larger dev team

Having reflected on the project week as a team, we believe that our strengths included:

- x
- y
- z

Lessons to take forward to future projects:

## Future Plans/Roadmap

We have planned to add the following functionality in any future sprints:

- Add additional dietary requirement filters, prioritising allergies
- Add functionality to allow crowd-sourced/user-posted recipes, which would reduce reliance on external meal API.
- Add dynamic update of recipe when making a different number of portions.
- Add budget category, so users can select from lower or higher budget recipes.
- Add functionality for users to share recipes on social media/whatsapp, etc.
- Add Dark Mode for reduced eye strain.

## Front-End Tools

![Front-end Tools](./public/front-end-tech.png)

In addition to technologies that we'd learned on the School of Code bootcamp, namely, React and Auth0, we also selected a number of tools that were new to the team, namely, Next.js, Vercel, Chakra UI and Tailwind CSS:

- Next.js was selected for its improved SEO and performance, dynamic routing, and server-side fetching and rendering.
- Vercel was used as the favoured deployment option for Next.js apps.
- Chakra UI was used for its simple-to-use and highly functional modular components, which enhanced the appearance and functionality of our app and reduced development time.
- Tailwind CSS was selected for convenient styling of custom components and responsive layouts.

## Dev Manual

The app can be viewed in deployment [here](https://chews.vercel.app/).

Alternatively, the front-end can be run locally, as follows:

(For details on also running the backend locally, please navigate [here](https://github.com/AdamPhasey/baristacrats-backend-repo))

Clone the project front-end and back-end repos separately:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/simonpartridge86/baristacrats-frontend-final-project.git
```

Navigate into the relevant folder and run the following terminal commands:

```bash
  npm install
  npm start
```

The app will automatically run on http://localhost:3000 by default, or the next available port otherwise.
